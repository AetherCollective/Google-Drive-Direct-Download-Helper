# Google-Drive-Direct-Download-Helper
This is a helper program that monitors the clipboard for Google Drive share links and asks the user if they want to convert the link into a direct download link.
For ease of use, the program starts with Windows automatically as the current user. You can turn this off by disabling it from the Task Manager.
